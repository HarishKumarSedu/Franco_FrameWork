QA Complete - API Interface

SmartBear QA Complete offers a REST API which can be used to enumerate projects,
find test sets, runs, tests, record test results, etc.

This module provides the facility for Python programs to interrogate and execute
test plans, allowing for centrally managed test campaigns whose executable code
is held elsewhere in Python.

For further detail, start at the :class:`qacomplete.connection` module.
