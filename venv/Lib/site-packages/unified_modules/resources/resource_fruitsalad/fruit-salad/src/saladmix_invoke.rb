module SaladMixInvoker

    # Sets the location of the precompiled saladmix binary. Can be set using
    # the :SaladMix_Location key. If set to nil fruitsalad will fall back to the
    # slower bash-script way of setting usecases.
    SaladMixLocation = Conf.property( :SaladMix_Location, nil )
    # Sets whether the location of saladmix is on a host machine (and thus needs
    # uploading to the target) or is already on the target, pre-installed.
    # Can be set with the :SaladMix_Upload key and should be either true (to
    # upload the binary from the host) or false.
