Saladmix is a more efficient implementation of tinymix designed to
expedite the loading of our usecases by performing block writes from a CSV file.

= Installation and Setup Notes =
Android crosscompiler can be obtained as part of the Android NDK.
Follow the instructions here: http://www.kandroid.org/ndk/docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html on how to set up a stand-alone toolchain.

Make debug will compile a native version of the saladmix tool (for use on Linux
as well as for debugging) but depends on ../vendor/tinyalsa being recompiled and
installed first.
