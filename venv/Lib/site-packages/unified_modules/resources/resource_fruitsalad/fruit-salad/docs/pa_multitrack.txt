Pa_multitrack usage

To configure a device via the GUI, start the application. The default device can be configured using the dropdown boxes. Then, save configuration or alternatively the values set can be used for manual configuration via command line.
Note only ASIO has been tested and working,  there are some issues using other host API’s.

To configure a device via command line (using parameters viewable in GUI mode),
Pa_multitrack HOST_API “DEVICENAME” SAMPLE_RATE BIT_DEPTH BUFFER_SIZE

To begin record/playback, 
Pa_multitrack “Path_to_tracklist.csv” record_time_in_samples(optional)

The tracklist file should be a comma separated file containing the .wav files to be played back as well as paths to files to be recorded to.
In the format: path_to_wav_file, input_channels, output_channels

Multiple input or output channels can be specified, separated by spaces.

E.g. 
test_tone.wav,,1
input.wav,2,
test_tone2.wav,,1 2

The record_time_in_samples is an optional argument specifying the time to playback and record signals in samples (seconds * sample rate). If not specified, playback will be limited at the longest playback file length.

The above will result in test_tone.wav being played through output 1 and well as test_tone2.wav being played through output 1 & 2. input.wav will be recorded from input 2.

Note that pa_multitrack expects any input audio files to be mono-channel only. Earlier version of the tool did not
correctly handle stereo input streams and would truncate playback. If you are seeing this issue check that input files are all mono-channel.

=== Dependencies ===

The pa_multitrack tool requires the Microsoft .NET 4.5 framework to operate correctly. If you see an error message like:
    "Unhandled Exception: System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Int32 System.Environment.get_ CurrentManagedThreadId()'"
check that a .NET framework is installed on your machine.
