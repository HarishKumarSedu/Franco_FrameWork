Release 1.0.15.0 - 13 May 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 1040.

New Features and Improvements:
 - Added guideline documentation on contributing to Fruit Salad (S2012).
 - Example feature for virtual room testing with SoundClear Control (S2049).
 - Initial troubleshooting FAQ added to the getting started guide.
 - Utility script added for generating Linux usecase scripts.

Work In Progress:
 - Devices will no longer have to be named for WISCE connections (S1992). 
 - WISCESalad methods added to allow use of the SPI communication protocol (S1991).
 - write_element_value method added to the WISCESalad class implementation (S2058).
 - Placement of microphones and sound sources in a virtual room (S2043).

Bug Fixes:
 - Support added for {FAIL} nested steps to allow for acceptance testing of the 
   FruitSalad framework - no more intentional failing steps (DE1330).
 - WISCEFirmwareInterface updated to check that the correct firmware revision
   was loaded (S1984).


Release 1.0.14.0 - 21 Apr 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 1007.
 
Work In Progress:
 - Devices will no longer have to be named for WISCE connections (S1992).
 - Example feature for virtual room testing with SoundClear Control (S2049).
 - WISCESalad methods added to allow use of the SPI communication protocol (S1991).

Bug Fixes:
 - Blue Box (TS-2000) playback saturating heavily, alleviated by increased attenuation in digital mixers (DE1342).
 - Null target no longer throws errors when executing features - unless deliberate failing test (DE1308).
 
Release 1.0.13.1 - 7 Apr 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 993.
 
Bug Fixes:
 - Additional resource file "two_tone_channel_test.wav" added.

Release 1.0.13.0 - 2 Apr 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 989.

New Features and Improvements:
 - WISCESalad::load_firmware updated to use the WISCE™ automation method LoadFirmware
   (still not enabled as the default method of loading firmware as this requires further 
   changes to be made available in version 3.3+ of WISCE™). (S1894)
 - Expanded documentation and examples of project usage of Fruit Salad. See "Fruit Salad
   Project Usage" in the help file list and the fruitsalad_example directory. (S2005) 
 - Multi-track playback through the TS-2000 "Blue Box" hardware using pa_multitrack enabled. (S1924)
   
Work In Progress:
 - Devices will no longer have to be named for WISCE connections (S1992).
 
Bug Fixes:
 - FFT analysis now uses a noise floor to determine when to discard information. The 
   "contains tones" steps have been expanded to allow this to be set on a per step basis
   with the threshold option in addition to the default and config settings. (DE1301)

Release 1.0.12.0 - 19 Mar 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 966.

New Features and Improvements:
 - Step definition update: Codec transitions now accepts 1 minute, singular.
 - Utility script added for measuring percentage of successful triggers for SoundClear 
   Control under various SNR conditions (S1927).
 - Additional configurability added to the SoundClear Control SNR measurement script (S1963)
 - Added support for running the SoundClear Control buffering test on the Arndale platform (S1960).
 - Added 'realistic' cafe_noise resources for use with testing - added as a separate 
   noise_resources archive to prevent bloating of the standard FruitSalad distributions (S1965).
 - Added support for bit-depth settings from configuration files and a test Raspberry 
   Pi file runner (S1962).
 - Added support for loading firmware solutions with dependencies on other firmware(s) (S1967).
 - Improved error handling in RemoteSalad (S1984).
 - Improved loading of configuration information for firmware (S1993).
 - Added option (--dump_config) to display the configuration options used during a FruitSalad run (S1993).
 - Scenario outline feature file example added for testing independent channels for several
   playback programs (DE1298).
 - Target rename (pi -> linux) to reflect that this target is not pi specific (S1995).
 - New step definition: FFT anaylsys can reject output if tones fall within a specified range (S1936).
   
Work In Progress:
 - Devices will no longer have to be named for WISCE connections (S1992).
 - FFT analysis now uses a noise floor to determine when to discard information (DE1301).

Bug Fixes:
 - Third party playback (Windows) now correctly supports independent volume control (DE1298).
 - Off-by-one fencepost error fixed in enum return value of CodecDevicePowerState.
 - FFT peak frequency calculation amended to use mean instead of mode (DE1296).
 - Expanded step definitions to allow specification of the playback program (wmp, metro and portaudio) (DE1299).
 - dBFS_to_f utility method updated to correctly handle floating point inputs (DE1302).
 
Release 1.0.11.1 - 10 Feb 2015
==============================
Subversion revision 871.

New Features:
 - Versioning information added to the initial Fruit Salad Guide and as options -v, --version when running the main script (S1955).

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed regression where WISCE™ target failed to reload usecase files after resetting (DE1286).
