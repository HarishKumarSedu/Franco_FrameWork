Known issue/s:
- SPI transactions are done using the Promira queue mechanism. SPI error code -32 (PS_APP_CONNECTION_LOST) may be
  returned when submitting queue, for which the Promira.py module re-establishes connection to the application and
  re-submits the queue. It can be observed that the transaction is actually done twice as a result of this - first from
  the failed queue submission and second from re-submitting the queue.
- Due to the above issue, the Promira.py module is not recommended for performing massive amounts of SPI read/write
  transactions, e.g. tests\peart_FPGA\halo\halo_mem_unpacked_via_spi.py
