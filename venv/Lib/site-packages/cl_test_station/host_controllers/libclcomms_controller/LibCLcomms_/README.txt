The LibCLcomms files can be downloaded from here...
https://edi-art-prod-01.ad.cirrus.com/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/Edi_Generic_Internal_Release_Local/UK_Apps/Cirrus_Comms_Library
The libCLcomms_64.dll was downloaded and placed into this folder

There currently isn't an official python api for the LibCLcomms but Graeme Towers seems to have placed a api on docs.com.
This api was downloaded and modified in a number of ways including updating this api to support python 3 resulting in
the LibCLComms_wrap.py that can be seen in this folder
